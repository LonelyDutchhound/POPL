Assumption in Question 6:
The execution suspends if and only if all of X1,...,Xn are unbound. It gives some result if any one of them is true or false.

Regarding Question 7:
Suspension is NOT considered in case of function calls
Reason:
    In our implementation of function call, we treat all the arguments which are passed as unbound variables, as variables which will carry the return value.
    That is, variables that will get bound during execution of the procedure
